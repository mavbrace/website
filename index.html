	   On the left is an example of a Ragdoll cat. 
	   </p> <p>
	   Ragdolls are large, laid-back, semi longhaired cats with captivating blue eyes. 
	   The Ragdoll is a pointed breed, which means that the body is lighter in color than the points (the face, legs, tail and ears). 
	   The Ragdoll cat is carefully bred to produce large affectionate animals in three patterns, two with white (mitted and bi-color)
	   and one with no white (colorpoint). The ideal Ragdoll is a well balanced cat, with no extreme features. Males will 
	   usually top the scale at 15-20 pounds; females are proportionately smaller and usually weigh between 10-15 pounds at maturity. 
	   Ragdolls are slow-maturing, reaching full coat color at two years, and full size and weight at four. They are a wonderful breed, 
	   and recommended for everyone.
	   </p> <p>
	   Domestic cats, no matter their breed, are all members of one species: felis catus. They have had a very long relationship with humans.
	   Ancient Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000 years ago. Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to 
	   human communities. The cats' skill in killing them may have first earned the affectionate attention of humans. Early Egyptians 
	   worshipped a cat goddess and even mummified their beloved pets for their journey to the next world - acompanied by mummified mice. 
	   Cultures around the world later adopted cats as their own companions.

	   Like their wild relatives, domestic cats are natural hunters able to stalk prey and pounce with sharp claws and teeth. They are
	   particularly effective at night, when their light-reflecting eyes allow them to see better than much of their prey. Cats also enjoy 
	   acute hearing. All cats are nimble and agile, and their long tails aid their outstanding balance.
